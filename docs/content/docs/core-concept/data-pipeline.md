# Definition
Since events in Flink CDC flow from the upstream to the downstream in a pipeline manner, the whole ETL task is referred as a **Data Pipeline**.

# Parameters
A pipeline corresponds to a chain of operators in Flink.   
To describe a Data Pipeline, the following parts are required:
- [source]({{< ref "docs/core-concept/data-source" >}})
- [sink]({{< ref "docs/core-concept/data-sink" >}})
- [pipeline](#pipeline-configurations)

the following parts are optional:
- [route]({{< ref "docs/core-concept/route" >}})
- [transform]({{< ref "docs/core-concept/transform" >}})

# Example
## Only required
We could use following yaml file to define a concise Data Pipeline describing synchronize all tables under MySQL app_db database to Doris :

```yaml
   source:
     type: mysql
     hostname: localhost
     port: 3306
     username: root
     password: 123456
     tables: app_db.\.*

   sink:
     type: doris
     fenodes: 127.0.0.1:8030
     username: root
     password: ""

   transform:
     - source-table: adb.web_order01
       projection: \*, UPPER(product_name) as product_name
       filter: id > 10 AND order_id > 100
       description: project fields and filter
     - source-table: adb.web_order02
       projection: \*, UPPER(product_name) as product_name
       filter: id > 20 AND order_id > 200
       description: project fields and filter

   route:
     - source-table: app_db.orders
       sink-table: ods_db.ods_orders
     - source-table: app_db.shipments
       sink-table: ods_db.ods_shipments
     - source-table: app_db.products
       sink-table: ods_db.ods_products

   pipeline:
     name: Sync MySQL Database to Doris
     parallelism: 2
```

## With optional
We could use following yaml file to define a complicated Data Pipeline describing synchronize all tables under MySQL app_db database to Doris and give specific target database name ods_db and specific target table name prefix ods_ :

```yaml
   source:
     type: mysql
     hostname: localhost
     port: 3306
     username: root
     password: 123456
     tables: app_db.\.*

   sink:
     type: doris
     fenodes: 127.0.0.1:8030
     username: root
     password: ""

   transform:
     - source-table: adb.web_order01
       projection: \*, format('%S', product_name) as product_name
       filter: addone(id) > 10 AND order_id > 100
       description: project fields and filter
     - source-table: adb.web_order02
       projection: \*, format('%S', product_name) as product_name
       filter: addone(id) > 20 AND order_id > 200
       description: project fields and filter

   route:
     - source-table: app_db.orders
       sink-table: ods_db.ods_orders
     - source-table: app_db.shipments
       sink-table: ods_db.ods_shipments
     - source-table: app_db.products
       sink-table: ods_db.ods_products

   pipeline:
     name: Sync MySQL Database to Doris
     parallelism: 2
     user-defined-function:
       - name: addone
         classpath: com.example.functions.AddOneFunctionClass
       - name: format
         classpath: com.example.functions.FormatFunctionClass
```

# Pipeline Configurations
The following config options of Data Pipeline level are supported:

| parameter               | meaning                                                                                                | optional/required |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| name                    | The name of the pipeline, which will be submitted to the Flink cluster as the job name.                | optional          |
| parallelism             | The global parallelism of the pipeline. Defaults to 1.                                                 | optional          |
| local-time-zone         | The local time zone defines current session time zone id.                                              | optional          |
| execution.runtime-mode  | The runtime mode of the pipeline includes STREAMING and BATCH, with the default value being STREAMING. | optional          |
