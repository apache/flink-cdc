      Unexpected key `execution` in YAML top-level block.
      Allowed keys in this context are: [source, sink, route, transform, pipeline]
      Note: Flink configurations should be defined in "Runtime Configurations" instead of YAML scripts.

      Unexpected key `transformers` in YAML route block.

      Note: option transformers: [{"type":"cast","fields":[{"name":"*","type":"BIT","target-type":"TINYINT"}]}] is unexpected.
      It was silently ignored in previous versions, and probably should be removed.
