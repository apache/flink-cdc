steps:
  # Unexpected top-level block
  - type: submit
    yaml: |
      source:
        type: values
      sink:
        type: values
      mapping:
        - source: userUuid
          sink: uuid
        - source: userId
          sink: user_id
        - source: deviceUuid
          sink: device_uuid
    error: |
      Unexpected key `mapping` in YAML top-level block.
      Allowed keys in this context are: [source, sink, route, transform, pipeline]
      Note: Flink configurations should be defined in "Runtime Configurations" instead of YAML scripts.
  # Unexpected transform block keys
  - type: submit
    yaml: |
      source:
        type: values
      sink:
        type: values
      transform:
        - source-table: foo.bar
          mapping:
            - source: userUuid
              sink: uuid
    error: |
      Unexpected key `mapping` in YAML transform block.
      Allowed keys in this context are: [source-table, projection, filter, primary-keys, partition-keys, table-options, description, converter-after-transform]
      Note: option mapping: [{"source":"userUuid","sink":"uuid"}] is unexpected. It was silently ignored in previous versions, and probably should be removed.
  # Unexpected route block keys
  - type: submit
    yaml: |
      source:
        type: values
      sink:
        type: values
      route:
        - source-table: foo.bar
          sink-table: fun.baz
          regex-style: java
    error: |
      Unexpected key `regex-style` in YAML route block.
      Allowed keys in this context are: [source-table, sink-table, replace-symbol, description]
      Note: option regex-style: "java" is unexpected. It was silently ignored in previous versions, and probably should be removed.
  # Unexpected UDF block keys
  - type: submit
    yaml: |
      source:
        type: values
      sink:
        type: values
      pipeline:
        user-defined-function:
          - name: addone
            classpath: org.apache.flink.cdc.udf.examples.%s.AddOneFunctionClass
            language: clojure
    error: |
      Unexpected key `language` in YAML UDF block.
      Allowed keys in this context are: [name, classpath]
      Note: option language: "clojure" is unexpected. It was silently ignored in previous versions, and probably should be removed.
