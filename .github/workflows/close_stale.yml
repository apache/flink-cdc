            under the project Flink using component tag Flink CDC. You must have a JIRA account in order to log cases and issues.
            If you donâ€™t have an ASF JIRA account, you can request one at the ASF Self-serve portal,

            This issue has been closed because Flink CDC doesn't use GitHub issue trackers.
