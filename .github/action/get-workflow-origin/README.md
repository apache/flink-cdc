# Context and motivation

Get Workflow Origin is an action that provides information about the pull requests that triggered the
workflow for the `pull_request` and `pull_request_review` events or for the `workflow_run` event
that is triggered by one of those events.

Often in those events you want to get more information about the source run than the
one provided directly via GitHub context.

For example, you would like to know what is the merge commit generated by pull request in case
the workflow is triggered by a pull request, or labels associated with the Pull Request.

This action provides outputs that give that information. You should add this action as first
one in your workflow and then you will be able to use those outputs using 'needs' dependency.

The `sourceRunId` input should not be specified in case of the `pull_request` event, but it should
be set to `${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}` in case of the `workflow_run` event.

## Development environment

It is highly recommended tu use [pre commit](https://pre-commit.com). The pre-commits
installed via pre-commit tool handle automatically linting (including automated fixes) as well
as building and packaging Javascript index.js from the main.ts Typescript code, so you do not have
to run it yourself.
